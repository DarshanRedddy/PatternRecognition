# Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM) - Circular Input Distribution

This project implements a 1D Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM) trained on a dataset of points sampled from **two concentric circles**.

It visualizes how the weight vectors evolve during training using a neighborhood function.

---

## üîß Features

- Generate synthetic 2D data points from two circles.
- Initialize weight vectors in a rectangular region.
- Train a SOM with decreasing learning rate and neighborhood.
- Visualize:
  - Input distribution & initial weights
  - Weight evolution over time (t = 0, 100, 1000)
  - Neighbor connections

## üöÄ How to Run on Google Colab

1. Open the notebook or Python script in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Run the code cells.
3. To download the output plots:

```python
from google.colab import files
files.download("outputs/turn_in_3_1000.png")  # Or use shutil to zip and download all
